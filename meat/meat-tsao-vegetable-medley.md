Meat-Tsao Vegetable Medley
=========================

As with many of my dishes, the birth of the Meat-Tsao Vegetable Medley came as a result of looking in the freezer for what was available. I lucked out with some ground beef and a bag of mixed vegetables. I also had a bottle of General Tsao Stir Fry Sauce that I picked up from Trader Joe's a week earlier so I thought this was a nice opportunity to try it with a meal.

A few minutes and steps yielded a nicely flavored meat dish that my kids not only loved because of it's sweetness but that even my wife thought was high-end restaurant quality. Not bad for an improvised meal.
